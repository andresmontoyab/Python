# Python Guidelines

## Pep8
## Python Zen

### PEP8

PEP8 it is a document in where it is described how to write Python Code, commonly it is a good practice
to follow the PEP8 recommendations

PEP8 says ```code is read much more often than it is written```, for that reason the PEP8 guidelines are focus to improve the readability of code
and make it consistent.

```Readability counts```

PEP8 It is a good guide to write our python code nevertheless ```we can not break backwards compatibility just to comply with this PEP!```,
so if our project already have style guidelines we must keep those rules.

#### Identation.

- Use 4 spaces per indentation level.
- The 4-space rule is optional for continuation lines.

```python

```


### Python Zen

The Python Zen was a set of lines that defines what is good way to write Python Code, the Python Zen was written by
Tim Peters and says:

- Beautiful is better than ugly
- Explicit is better than implicit
- Simple is better than complex
- Flat is better than nested
- Sparse is better than dense
- Readability counts
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules
- Although practicality beats purity
- Errors should never pass silently
- Unless explicitly silenced
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than right now
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those.
