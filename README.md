## What is Python

## Variables

Every single programming lenaguage has variables, now we are going to talk about what are the python variables types.

* integer: Are used to define numeric values
* long_integer: Are used to define values with a bigger value than a intenger
* float: Are used to define decimal values
* String: Are used to define c

```python
an_integer = 10
an_float= 2.1
an_string = 'Name'
```

One important thing about python is that is a non-type language, that means that our variables do not require to have a type.

## Operators

Within Python we have different operators, in this section we are going to see of all them.

### Arithmetic

As many other languagues python support arithmetic operators like the sum, substraction and product, let's see how to use them:

- ```sum``` :  +
- ```substraction``` :  -
- ```product``` :  *
- ```division``` :  /
- ```module``` :  %

### Comparision

We also can compare two values in python with the next symbols:

- ```equals``` :  ==
- ```different``` :  !=
- ```less than``` :  <=
- ```greater than``` :  >=
- ```is``` :  is
- ```not``` :  not

When we use the above operators the result is a boolean condition.


### Logical

In every language is very important to deal with boolean types, for this reason we need the logical operators:

- ```and``` :  and
- ```or``` :  or
- ```not``` :  not
